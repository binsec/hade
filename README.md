# Killing Symbolic Deobfuscation For Free

Section VI (Experimental Evaluation) sources are available in the [experimental_data](https://github.com/binsec/hade/tree/master/experimental_data) folder.

Section VII (Hardened Deobfuscation Benchmark) sources are available in the [hardened/path_coverage](https://github.com/binsec/hade/tree/master/hardened/path_coverage) folder.

In the [hardened/secret_finding](https://github.com/binsec/hade/tree/master/hardened/secret_finding) folder we propose a challenge with secret-finding oriented programs.

All experiments have been conducted on a x86-64 architecture.
